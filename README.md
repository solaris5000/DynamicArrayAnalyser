# DynamicArrayForAnalysys

This is my small project with c++, where is tried to figure out is there any correlation between the size of dinamycly taked memore by new[] function and the address in memory that it used, ive not found it.

Ive managed output to just copy it from command line and import as csv file to analys is some kind of Excell.

Also there is 2 kind of stats, one of them is commented.

1: stats of address used as start of new array
2: stats of address used as start of new array of exact size
